# teratogenicity-qsar
This repository contains supplemental code and data files for the publication "Machine learning on drug-specific data to predict small molecule teratogenicity" by Challa et al.

We present our data as follows:
1. The "Source Data" folder contains a listing of all drugs evaluated in this project, all drug-matched teratogenicity scores extracted from SafeFetus, and all other data files that are called by the R scripts that we developed for our investigation.

2. The "Scripts" folder contains all R scripts that we developed for parsing structural, meta-structural, Tox21 data, and teratogenicity scores. The most critical scripts contain detailed headers describing the intention of the succeeding code. All data files required to execute these scripts are available in "Source Data," and necessary R inheritances are clearly defined at the start of each code file.
